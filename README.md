## Introduction

Credit risk assessment is a critical process for financial institutions, helping them decide whether to approve or deny loan applications. This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan.

## Project Overview

This project includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering to create new predictors
- Implementation of advanced modeling techniques
- Model evaluation and selection
- Model interpretation using SHAP values
- Deployment of the model as an API

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains historical loan data, including features such as loan amount, borrower income, credit score, and more. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

## Feature Engineering

We have created several new features to enhance the predictive power of our models, including:
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Aggregated transaction history
- Credit utilization rate

## Modeling Techniques

We have experimented with a variety of machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

Advanced ensemble methods such as stacking, bagging, and boosting were also implemented to improve prediction accuracy.

## Results

Our models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The LightGBM model with hyperparameter tuning provided the best performance.

## Model Interpretation

To ensure transparency and interpretability, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to explain model predictions and understand feature importance.

## Conclusion

Our advanced modeling techniques significantly improved the accuracy of credit risk predictions. The feature importance analysis provided valuable insights into the key factors influencing credit risk.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to this project could include:
- Integration with external data sources like economic indicators
- Implementation of a real-time scoring API
- Further exploration of model explainability techniques
- Scenario analysis for different economic conditions
